### UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The content in this section will be an adaption of the classic
introduction to R, [IPSUR](http://ipsur.org/). As part of this
process, I want to make sure I am giving back to the author and I will
be offering my changes / edits upstream.

### Differences

I have not (yet) decided what I will call my IPSUR fork. I doubt I am
able to come up with such a nice acronym. . . . . and there are
already too many acronyms in this world without me adding to the
mess. While the materials will rely heavily on IPSUR, there will be
several important differences:

- Written in Markdown, not org-mode.

    I LOVE org-mode and use it heavily in my personal life. But,
    the collaborative opportunities for working in Markdown are
    many. This website is a good example. By writing in Markdown, I am
    able to publish beautifully strucutured HTML, without having to
    type a single bracket.

- Different Audience

    The original material is written for a undergrad statistics
    course. Research Scientists at the New York State Department of
    Health are unlikely to need such a detailed explanation of the
    underlying statistical principles. Balancing those differences may
    be difficult.

- Place Holder - I'm sure I've forgotten at least one difference!
