## What Is the Analytic Toolbox?

The Analytic Toolbox is a collection of GitHub repositories and online
resources I use to make my life a little easier as an analyst. This
page (and any other pages in this folder) will serve as the temporary
home / wiki for the Analytic Toolbox until I create something more
permanent.

## Rationale

Every analysis is different, yet _much_ of what we do as analysts is
the same every single time. Think about your own work. You obtain a
data set. You write some code to analyze it. You write a report.

Rinse. Wash. Repeat.

Several years ago I realized I was wasting an enormous amout of time
building the same basic structures for each project. Even worse, I was
doing it slightly differently every time. Working with code I had
written only months before was sometimes a challenge, because I was
unintentionally changing my own structure on a continual basis.

I would rather do things the same way every time, unless there is a
very good reason not to. Examples:

- Unless all of my data is coming straight out of a database query. I
always create a "data" folder to hold me data extracts.
- I always create a "report" folder to contain my LaTeX or Rmd
files.
- I like to have the same strucuture and sections in each of my
files. All boilerplate and all repetitive.

The goal of the "Analytic Toolbox" series, is to provide as much of
this repetitive boilerplate as possible. It is designed to be
extremely flexible. Use the parts that work for you. Ignore anything
you don't like. Over time I intend to add everything from style guides
to configuration / setup tools.

Have fun!
