### UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The content in this section will be a collection of INTRODUCTORY
materials for SQL. I will probably use Postgres as my basis. The
Department of Health uses Oracle and Postgres is as similar as I can
get in a freely available, open-source platform but I am sure that I
will have to document the differences as they arise.
