    <a name="1stFridayAlbanyWebsite"><h2>1st Friday Albany Website</h2></a>
    <p>
        I wrote and maintain the
        <a href="http://www.1stfridayalbany.org/" target="_blank">
            1st Friday Albany
        </a> website for the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild.
        </a>
        The UAG promotes a monthly arts night in the Capital
        District. To do so, we collaborate with local businesses,
        artists and media outlets. We are the first and oldest (and
        best) arts night in the Capital District. As of September
        2016, we are 10 years old!
    </p>
    <p>
        The 1st Friday website is a static
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll site</a>,
        using a custom
        <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation 6</a>
        theme. This incarnation of the 1st Friday Albany website went
        live early January of 2016 and has met our needs, thus
        far. Unlike the previous page, it is fully responsive (looks
        good on phones, tablets, and large-screen monitors). I will
        eventually replace it with something more dynamic or port it
        to Hexo or Pelican, to reduce the amount of Ruby I have to
        work with.

        If anyone would like to volunteer to help me with this
        project, I am accepting pull requests.

    <p>
        My blog, Nullius in verba, is technically a web development
        project. The current incarnation is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">
        Jekyll
        </a> (using the excellent
        <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/" target="_blank">
            Lanyon
        </a> theme) and is hosted via GitHub. I really like the
        simplicity of the theme and would like to keep it when I
        eventually port everything to either Pelican or Hexo.
    
    <a name="BloodSugarsProject"><h2>Blood Sugars Project</h2></a>
    <p>
        This ongoing analysis project began in 2015. I want to better
        understand my wife's Type 1 diabetes. Eventually, I would like
        to use her CGM data to predict future blood glucose
        levels. This project has been in hiatus for several months,
        but I intend to resurrect it at some point in early
        2017. Karen has been using a different CGM, which doesn't work
        with Nightscout and the baby (Monkey!) has reduced the amount
        of time I have available for side projects.
    </p>

    <p> You can track this project on its own page:
        <a href="https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/" target="_blank">
            https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/
        </a>. Eventually, I intend to produce a CGM-driven Shiny
        portal Karen can use when she goes to see her endocrinologist,
        but that is more of a long-term goal.

        A workshop on Propensity Score Matching (PSM). The workshop
        demonstrates how PSM is an improvement over using multiple
        linear regression to control for differences between the
        intervention group and the non-scientific control group. This
        is a new project (started August, 2016) and with my recent
        reductions in free time, may take a while to get finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will link to the materials here when they are ready to be
        seen by others.

    <a name="TITR"><h2>Titanic Introduction To R (TITR)</h2></a>

    <p>
        An introduction to R workshop, used to introduce analysts to
        R. It is a series of presentations (reveal.js), code (R), and
        data (CSV), I use to teach the fundamentals of using R as an
        interactive analysis tool. I assume participants have little
        to no programming experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The materials are available here:

    </p>
    <p>
        The website is built using
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">
            Jekyll

        <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/" target="_blank">

        I maintain, but did not write, the primary
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild
        </a>
        website. I intend to replace this website during 2017. If
        anyone would like to volunteer to help me with this project,
        please contact me.
