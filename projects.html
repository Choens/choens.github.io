            Current projects and interests, in alphabetical
            order. External links will open in a new tab. Most of the
            projects listed here are licensed with a copy-left license
            or I haven't bothered to license them explicitly, in which
            case they are in the public domain. Projects are a mix of
            web development and analytical.

        I wrote and maintain the
        <a href="http://www.1stfridayalbany.org/" target="_blank">
            1st Friday Albany
        </a> website for the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild.
        </a>
        Working with local business, churches, non-profits, etcetera,
        the UAG promotes a monthly arts night in the Capital
        District. We are the first and oldest such arts night in the
        Capital District and we turn 10 in September, 2016!
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to being the UAG's official code monkey, I am a
        board member (in charge of web-stuff) and promote the 1st
        Friday Albany and UAG brands on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/UpstateArtGuild">social media</a>.
    <p>
        In terms of tech, the 1st Friday website is a static
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll site</a>,
        using a custom
        <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation 6</a>
        theme. This incarnation of the 1st Friday Albany website went
        live early January of 2016 and has met our needs, thus
        far. Unlike the previous page, it is fully responsive (looks
        good on phones, tablets, and large-screen monitors). Going
        forward, I will replace it with something more dynamic or port
        it to Hexo or Perlican, to reduce the amount of Ruby I have to
        work with.  But frankly, I enjoy the simplicity of a static
        site.

        project, I am accepting pull requests.

    <a name="BloodSugarsProject"><h2>Blood Sugars Project</h2></a>

    <p>
        This is a analytical project I started in 2015, to better
        understand my wife's Type 1 diabetes. Eventually, I would like
        to use her CGM data to predict future blood glucose
        levels. This project has been in hiatus for several months,
        but I intend to resurrect it at some point in late 2016. Karen
        has been using a different CGM, which doesn't work with
        Nightscout and the baby (Monkey!) has reduced the amount of
        time I have available for side projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can track this project on its own page:
        <a href="https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/" target="_blank">
            https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/
        </a>. Eventually, I intend to produce a CGM-driven Shiny
        portal Karen can use when she goes to see her endocrinologist,
        but that is probably several months away.

        A reusable set of materials to help me explain and teach
        co-workers about Propensity Score Matching, as a improvement
        over using simple linear regressions to control for
        differences between the intervention group and the
        non-scientific control group. This is a new project (started
        August, 2016) and with my recent reductions in free time, may
        take a while to get finished.

    <a name="TITR"><h2>Titanic Introduction To R (TITR)</h2></a>

    <p>
        A turn-key workshop, because I enjoy teaching analyst and
        students how to use R. It is a series of presentations
        (reveal.js), code (.R), and data (CSV), I use to teach the
        fundamentals of R programming. I assume participants
        have little to no programming experience outside of languages
        such as SPSS and SAS, which tend to encourage bad habits.
    </p>
    <p>
        The materials are available here:
        <a href="http://choens.github.io/titanic/" target="_blank">
            http://choens.github.io/titanic/
        </a>. The website is built using
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">
            Jekyll
        </a> (using the excellent
        <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/" target="_blank">
           Lanyon
        </a> theme)and
        <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" target="_blank">
            Reveal.js
        </a>. Feel free to re-use this material. If you do, please drop me a quick
        <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">
            email
        </a> and let me know how it went. If anyone would like to

        I maintain, but did not write, the primary
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild
        </a>
        website. I intend to replace this website during 2017. If
        anyone would like to volunteer to help me with this project,
        please contact me.
