        Below is a collection of some of my current and ongoing
        projects in alphabetical order. All links (I do like links)
        will open in a separate tab. Most of the project listed here
        are licensed under a copy-left license.

    <h2>1st Friday Albany Website:</h2>
    <p>
        I wrote and maintain the
        <a href="http://www.1stfridayalbany.org/" target="_blank">
            1st Friday Albany
        </a> website for the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild
        </a>
        (I am a board member and code-monkey.) 1st Friday Albany is a
        monthly regional arts event. By working with Albany business,
        churches, nonprofits and organizations, the UAG is able to
        promote a monthly night of art for the Capital District. We
        are the first and oldest such art night in the Capital
        District.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website is actually static. It is a custom
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">
            Jekyll
        </a> theme I built using
        <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">
            Zurb Foundation 6
        </a>. The current 1st Friday Albany page went live in early
        January, 2016 and has met our needs well thus far. Unlike the
        previous page, it is fully responsive and looks good on
        phones, tablets, and large-screen monitors. In the future, I
        intend to replace it with something more dynamic and
        sophisticated, but I appreciate and enjoy the simplicity of
        being able to write a sophisticated page, that is nothing by
        HTML, CSS and Javascript (assembled by Ruby).

        If anyone would like to volunteer to help me with this
        project, I am accepting pull requests.

    <h2>Blood Sugars Project:</h2>

    <p>
        This is a analytic project I started in 2015, to use my wife's
        CGM data to predict future blood glucose levels. This project
        has been in hiatus for several months, but I intend to
        resurrect it at some point in 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can track this project on its own page:
        <a href="https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/" target="_blank">
            https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/
        </a>. Eventually, I intend to produce a CGM-driven Shiny
        portal Karen can use when she goes to see her endocrinologist,
        but that is probably several months away.

    <h2>Titanic Introduction To R:</h2>

    <p>
        A series of web-based presentations, code, and data, I wrote
        to help me teach the fundamentals of R
        programming. Participants are assumed to have completed a
        college-level statistics course, but are not expected to have
        programming experience. I assume participants have little to
        no programming experience outside of languages such as SPSS
        and SAS, which tend to encourage bad habits.

    <h2>Upstate Artists Guild Website:</h2>
    <p>
        I maintain, but did not write, the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild
        </a>
        website. I intend to replace this website during 2016. If
        anyone would like to volunteer to help me with this project,
        please contact me.
