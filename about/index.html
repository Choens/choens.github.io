        This is the blog of Andy Choens. This is my little place on
        the 'Net. I mostly talk about my family, technology,
        statistics, politics, and my adventures in the great
        outdoors. These words are mine and do not necessarily
        represent the opinion of my employer or organizations I work
        with.

    <p>
        Today, data is everywhere in human services. Data science is
        the practice of extracting knowledge from data. It sits at the
        intersection of domain expertise, traditional research and
        statistics skills, and software development skills. I am equal
        parts social worker, business consultant, program evaluator,
        and computer programmer. I help clients convert their data
        into knowledge.

        I am an experienced program evaluator with experience in child
        welfare, elder-care, health care, housing, and juvenile
        justice. I earned my MSW at

            SUNY Albany's School of Social Welfare
        </a>. I currently work for

        </a> evalution for the New York State Department of Health. I
        have a strong background in direct clinical practice, program

        I live in Albany, NY with my (lovely) wife and our (even
        lovelier) daughter. I am a board member of the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        There are several ways to reach me. Email is generally the
        best / fastest way to get a response. I check my LinkedIn page
        infrequently and I hate voice mail.
