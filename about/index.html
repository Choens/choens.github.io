    <p>
        I am a social worker, program evaluator, and computer
        programmer (geek). I live in Albany, NY with my (lovely) wife
        and our (even lovelier) daughter. I am a board member of the
        <a href="http://upstateartistsguild.org/" target="_blank">
            Upstate Artists Guild(UAG)
        </a>. I maintain both the UAG website and the <a href="http://1stfridayalbany.org/" target="_blank">1st Friday Albany</a> website. In my free time I build and ride trails with the
        <a href="http://saratogamtb.org/" target="_blank">
            Saratoga Mountain Biking Association
        </a>. During the winter, I like to disappear into the North
        Country to enjoy back-country skiing. This blog is my little
        place on the 'Net. I'll probably mostly talk about my family,
        computers, politics, and my adventures.

        Professionally, I am an experienced program evaluator with
        experience in child welfare, elder-care, health care, housing,
        and juvenile justice. I earned my MSW at
        <a href="http://www.albany.edu/ssw/msw.php" target="_blank">
            SUNY Albany's School of Social Welfare
        </a>. I currently work for
        <a href="http://ipro.org/" target="_blank">
            IPRO
        </a> and work on the
        <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_health_homes/" target="_blank">
            Health Homes
        </a> evalution for the New York State Department of Health. I
        have a strong background in direct clinical practice, program
        evaluation, and data analysis. See my <a href="https://github.com/Choens/projects">projects page</a> for example analyses and training materials I have written.

         I maintain my <a href="https://github.com/Choens/resume" target="_blank">resume on GitHub</a>,
        because I'm a geek. You can download my current <a href="https://github.com/Choens/resume/raw/master/Andy%20Choens%20-%20Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume (PDF)</a> and a list of <a href="https://github.com/Choens/resume/raw/master/Andy%20Choens%20-%20Example%20Projects.pdf" target="_blank">example projects (PDF)</a>. Feel
        free to contact me at my <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">personal email address</a></li> if you would
        like to discuss a job opportunity or professional
        collaboration.

        There are several ways to reach me. Email is generally the
        best / fastest way to get a response. I check my LinkedIn page
        infrequently and I hate voice mail.
