excerpt: Lamentations regarding my own artistic inability.

I'm not an artist. Can you tell? This blog is living proof that I have
practically no artistic sense of self. In terms of computers and other
living spaces, I tend to prefer minimalism, but I confess, this blog
is FUGLY.

Oh well.

I have been spending my evenings setting up a new project which I'm
calling [Blood Sugars](https://choens.github.io/blood-sugars/). The
gh-pages site looks much better than my blog. I may try to port the
theme from Blood Sugars to this pathetic thing.
