To celebrate my Pass Day, I rode my mountain bike all over to Pine
Hills Park in Vermont. Amusement was had. I have never been there
before and had no idea what to expect but I had heard good things.

In a nutshell, it is small but of very high quality. From Albany, the
drive is probably a little longer than it is worth, but if I were a
local (Rutland, VT), I would ride there every week. The trails were
very well laid out and did a lot in a very small amount of area. Not
overly technical. More fast and flowy (not sure flowy is a word).

Being Vermont, there's always a good view at the top. With a little
effort, good views are available. The trails are laid out well enough
that even though this park is literally built onto the side of a small
mountain, I was able to ride there with my single-speed without any
real trouble.

I was also impressed by the amount of contruction done on some of the
trails. Bermed corners were common as were bridges to prevent erosion
in wet spots. In fact, some of the bridges are just crazy.

I would like to ride there in the fall. It was a hot day when I
visited and some of the climbs were more tiring than necessary because
of the heat. Given the amount of work they put into these trails, I
assume they do a good job of keeping them clear of leaf clutter. I
suspect this place is a riot on a cool fall day.
