To celebrate my Pass Day, I rode Pine Hills Park in Vermont. Amusement
was had. I have never ridden in VT before and had no idea what to
expect. I had heard good things about Pine Hills and they were all true.

In a nutshell, it is a small, high quality set of trails in Rutland,
VT. It took me a little over two hours to get there from
Albany. Because it is small and kinda far away; I don't think I will
ride there regularly. But if I were a local, I would ride there every
week. The trails were very well laid out and did a lot in a small
amount of area. The trails are not overly technical. Unlike Pitstown
and SMBA, they don't jar you pieces or expect you to ride over mammoth
rock elements. These trails are fast and flow well. Berms, jumps, and
high speed riding is the norm here.

Being Vermont, there's always a good view at the top. The trails are
laid out well. I was able to ride there with my single-speed without
any real trouble, in spite of the fact the trails are on the side of a
small "mountain". It was a hot day and the heat often slowed me down
more than the hills did.

I was impressed by the amount of contruction and maintenance on some
of the trails. Bermed corners were common and the trails are littered
with little booters to fly off of. They make good use of the rocky
landscape. And they build some kick-ass bridges to prevent erosion/mud
in wet spots. The suspension bridge was, by far, my favorite. Riding
on a suspension bridge on a bicycle is trippy feeling.

I would like to ride there again this fall. It was a hot the day I
visited and some of the climbs were more tiring than necessary because
of the heat. Given the amount of work they put into these trails, I
assume they do a good job of keeping them clear of leaf clutter. I
suspect this place is a riot on a cool fall day.
