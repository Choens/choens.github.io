# Hello World

This is my first, rather crude attempt to blog via Jekyll / Github. As
my understanding of this increases, I'll see if I can increase the
complexity.

As of today, 2014-06-07, I have not theme, no real structure and I'm
just reading a couple of How-To's and hacking at this.

As an updat on 2014-07-24, I now have a theme and the something that
is BEGINNING to resemble a structure. Time to start blogging. Or
something. I can practice typing if nothing else.
