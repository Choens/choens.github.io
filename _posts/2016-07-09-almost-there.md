Success! We spent most of the day at Albany Med (of course). Leila is
doing great. More on that later. But we are still chilling in the
NICU. Today, I spent some of that time working on the laptop and wrote
lots and lots of backposts. I still need to get Karen's AWESOME videos
up and a few of her pictures, but this finishes most of my old
pictures.

Ha! Old . . . none of them are more than two months . . . old. Whatever.

I've got a picture or two from today I'd like to share and some
AWESOME video, but for some reason my phone is NOT wanting to sync to
Google's cloud. Not sure why. Once I figure that out, I'll update /
tweak this post with a pic or two and a video.
