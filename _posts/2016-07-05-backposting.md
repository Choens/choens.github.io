excerpt: "Again. I am bad. I will do better. For Monkey."

I am, apparently, a horrible person. My daughter was born on May 12 of
this year. Yet, it took me nearly two months to write anything about
it here. 

Clearly, I must make amends.

I am going to write some back posts, documenting the journey of my
Monkey. She deserves that and so much more. To recap, she was born
over two months early. She has been in NICU all this time. She was a
mere four pounds, nine ounces when she was born. 

She is perfect.

**Question:** Why is her nickname Monkey? 

**Answer:** Because she makes monkey sounds! On the day she was born,
and every day since, she has made these little squeaks. Sometimes they
sound like a premature laugh. They are adorable. And for some reason,
they made me thing of a monkey.

And there you have it. The origin of the Monkey.
