I confess. I am a bad bad boy. I have this place, and I don't use it
enough. This summer, K and I took part in some awesome adventures.

1. We went to Ireland. Yeah. Frickin' Ireland. Guinness == Awesome.
2. I led a 24.5 mile mountain bikie ride, on my single-speed. Need to
   start thinking about next year's Epic Ride. We need to tighten up
   on our safety planning.
3. We repainted the front patio. Turns out, this was 100x more work
   than I expected. My time-frame estimates are worth what I paid
   for - nothing.
4. We rebuilt our basement. +1 for carbon fiber. This is actually a
   work in progress, we haven't gotten it painted yet. The
   construction is done, the painting is not. Should be done
   completely by the end of this weekend. I'm getting tired of going
   to the laundromat.

It has been a busy summer and I keep meaning to post some pictures,
but I don't. I'll get some pictures posted here soon! I'll back-date
as appropriate for future reference.
