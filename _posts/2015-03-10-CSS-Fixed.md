I have repaired the CSS theming under Chromium/Chrome. Apparently,
Blink blocks downloading CSS files that are linked with http:// urls
when the site it otherwise delivered in https://. Not a bad idea, but
I hadn't really stopped to think about it, and thus Google ignored my
CSS file.

Although it is arguably a little picky (pickier than Firefox), it does
make sense. You shouldn't split the connections between http:// and
https://. Not a particular concern on a site like this, but on other
sites it could be a big deal.

Google wins that round. Apologies to anyone who came here when it
looked like crap.
