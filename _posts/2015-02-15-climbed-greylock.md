Spent the day climbing Greylock and shoveling snow in the driveway. We
have had lots of snow this year. Other than the monster icicles on the house (and the
frozen pipes) I can't complain.

The first image is a picture of the valley from near the summit of
Mount Greylock. I have to thank Google for turning into a black and
white photo.

This is a selfie from the actual summit. The Greylock monument is
behind me. My photos from inside the warming hut near the summit all
came out badly, so this is my only selfie of the day.
