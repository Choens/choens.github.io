excerpt: "All she knows, is NICU."

Hard to think about, but she is now over a month old and she has never
been anywhere but the NICU at Albany Med. She is getting bigger and
bigger, but we are still fighting the feeds. I hope once we get the GI
issues resolved she can come home.

We start out our collection of Monkey pics today with a picture of the
sleeping Leila.

In the meantime, I can take lots of silly monkey pictures. This next
one is a little blurry, but I like it. It speaks to me, even if she doesn't.

Another closeup. I seem to like close-ups.
