Earlier in 2016, I became a board member of the UAG. I was already
maintaining the website, helpig with billing, etc. Why not actually
join? Besides, my favorite person in the universe is the Treasurer.

Earlier in the year, I rewrote the 1st Friday Albany page. I replaced
the previous, static PHP page with a static page of awesome thanks to
Jekyll and Zurb Foundation. The new site is totally awesome (although
I am a little biased). Most importantly, it looks just as good on a
phone, a tablet or a TV. The old page was nearly unusable on a phone,
and in today's world that just isn't good enough.

So, not that anyone reads this page, but I hope everyone who does
comes out and joins us this Friday in yet another celebration of ART
and my adopted home-town of Albany, NY.

Until then, HAVE FUN!
