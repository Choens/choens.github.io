Worked in the yard today. Took some photos to prove it.Our yard is
literally just a postage stamp of land, but it seems to need a lot of attention.

After mowing the lawn and generally tidying things up, I worked on the
bush-infested mess on the side of the house. It is now much improved.

All that cutting, means I have a serious pile of garbage in front of
the house.
