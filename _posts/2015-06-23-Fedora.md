After many many years of using K/Ubuntu exclusively on all of my
computers, I am flirting with Red Hat's Fedora. K's laptop is still running
Kubuntu, but mine is not and I'm getting ready to rebuild a server
with Fedora instead of Ubuntu. IIRC, I ran Fedora Core 1 briefly. I
liked it alright. But there were several releases with show-stopper
bugs and Ubuntu seemed to be moving from strength to strength at that
time. I was tired of RPM-Hell, after many years of using RPM-based
distros (Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake). Prior to using Ubuntu, I had never
used a Debian distro.

### Impetus for the Flirtation

Truthfully, I really like Ubuntu and I when I can buy a tablet with
Ubuntu pre-installed I will probably pony up. I like a lot of what
Ubuntu is doing and I continue to think 15.04 is the nicest Kubuntu
release in a long time. It is SHARP.

Several months ago, my dependable Dell XPS 13 unexpectedly died. I
nearly bought another one, because it is a terrific laptop. Instead, I
did something crazy. I drove down to Best Buy and bought a Microsoft
Surface Pro 3. Yeah. Crazy. Ubuntu never quite worked on it. Or
rather, it never worked *well* and it required endless fiddling /
configuration.

For example:

- Suspend never worked reliably.
- Touchpad support continued to be flakey.
- To get UEFI to work, I had to keep a Windows partition, which
  effectively wasted part of the Harddrive.
- KMail continues to live in the late 90's.
- Thunderbird is a hot-mess.


But the real killer is that the Surface Pro 3 is a tablet/laptop
hybrid. Kubuntu Touch did not survive to 15.04. Plasma desktop did,
but not the tablet interface. I don't know why. Unity 7 sucks on this
thing and Unity 8 is still an unstable hot mess. Thus I found myself
owning a tablet/laptop hybrid which I was forced to use as a laptop
because I didn't have a decent touch-oriented interface.

And then I noticed some glowing reviews of Gnome 3.16, especially on
Phoronix. I looked at some screenshots and I was impressed. Then I
stumbled upon a Git repo, run by some engineers at Intel, providing
customized Fedora kernels for the Surface Pro 3. Reviews seemed to
indicate people liked their work.

After testing Fedora on a USB key briefly, I copied my files to the
network and wiped the drive. With a little fiddling, I was able to
wipe out the Windows partition and have a
single-OS-Surface-Pro. AWESOME. The intel repo is everything I had
hoped it would be. Shutting down is still a little flakey sometimes,
but the custom kernel has solved most of my major problems.

Gnome 3 continues to evolve. To me, it doesn't feel as smooth as
Plasma 5 in many ways. It just seems a little rough around the edges,
but there are some terrific ideas here. Gnome Shell isn't as
configurable as Plasma, but the extensions are cool, if a little hard
for new users to discover/understand. Apps like Evolution and
Rhythmbox, long staples of Gnome desktops appear to be deprecated and
don't quite fit with the new Gnome HIG, but the replacement apps like
Geary and Gnome Music aren't really feature-complete or entirely
stable. I'm using Geary but continue to use Rhythmbox.

All that said, it is fun to use another desktop. Emacs works well
regardless of what desktop I use and it is more important than the
desktop specifics. My biggest problem is that I keep trying to start
konsole, which isn't installed on this computer. Gnome Software then
offers to install it for me. My fingers aren't used to starting
gnome-terminal. But that is a minor gripe.

For me, this is working. Gnome Software is beautiful, but there are
many applications missing from the catalog because of the ongoing
efforts to fill-in missing App Data.

All-in-all, it is fun, but I think K's computer will continue to run
Kubuntu for a while.
