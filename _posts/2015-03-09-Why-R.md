Last week, I gave a presentation to the New York State Department of
Health SAS User's Group. They were a delightfully nice group of
people. I spent nearly an hour talking about why a SAS user might want
to use R, and they didn't even throw me out! Delightful. Some audience
members had threatened me with tomatoes and other fruit/vegetable
matter, but apparently the security officer at the entrance to the
Wadsworth Center disarmed them. No fruits, vegetables or speakers were
harmed.

For the time being, slides can be found here:

I have been invited to do a repeat performance in June, 2015 at the
Albany Chapter of the American Statistical Association. For that
presentation, I will probably tweak / alter the presentation for this
group. To download / view a version of the slides / presentation as I
presented to NYSSUG in March 2015, follow the link below to my GitHub
account and follow the directions there:
