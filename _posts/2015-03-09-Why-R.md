Last week, I gave a presentation to the New York State Department of
Health SAS User's Group. They were a delightfully nice group of
people. I spent nearly an hour talking about why a SAS user might want
to use R, and they didn't even throw me out! Delightful. Some audience
members had threatened me with tomatoes and other fruit/vegetable
matter, but apparently the security officer at the entrance to the
Wadsworth Center disarmed them. No fruits, vegetables or speakers were
harmed.

The slides can be found here:

I have been invited to do a repeat performance in June, 2015 at the
Albany Chapter of the American Statistical Association. For that
presentation, I will probably tweak / alter the presentation for this
group. To download / view a version of the slides / presentation as I
presented to NYSSUG in March 2015, follow the link below to my GitHub
account and follow the directions there:
