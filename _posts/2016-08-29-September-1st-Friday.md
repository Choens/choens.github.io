Spread the word! We are celebrating 10 years of 1st Friday Albany at
the UAG! This is shaping up to be one for the history books. School is
back in session (meaning more people on the street) and we have
several new participants this month, combined with some old
participants we haven't seen in a while. I am really looking forward
to this.
