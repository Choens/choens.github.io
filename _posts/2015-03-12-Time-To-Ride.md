excerpt: Found an old video of some friends riding at SMBA and it got
me to thinking about the upcoming season of MTB hillarity.

Although there is still plenty of snow still on the ground (MRG, here
I COME!) it is time to start thinking about hitting the
trails. Monday, I went out for my first road ride of the season and
got spanked. Sunday I did a high-tempo 6 mile run and apparently my
legs had not recovered. Only managed to pull in a 13 MPH ride on my
usual route.

But, in the vein of getting ready for some trail riding, here's a
terrific video of Corey, Sandra and Cassidy hitting SMBA. I'm not
sure, but I think Cassidy might be having the most fun!
