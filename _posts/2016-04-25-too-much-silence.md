I got distracted by reality for a while. What can I do? It happens. In
fact, lots and lots of things have happened.

1. Karen and I are expecting our first child, sometime in late
   June. Yep. There it is. Leila, our daughter, will be running around
   the place and (hopefully) charming / annoying the neighbors.
2. Winter sucked. I couldn't bring myself to go out to the
   mountains. Conditions didn't warrant paying for a lift
   ticket. Unlike #1, this was a big disapointment.
3. So, I bought a fat bike. After years of rocking it out with the
   Single Speed, I finally bought a MTB with gears. I bought a Trek
   Farley and it rocks. If it can't climb it, the problem is probably
   the ape on top.
   
So there you have it. Lots of news in a very short post.
