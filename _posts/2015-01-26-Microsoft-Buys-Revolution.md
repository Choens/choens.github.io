Interesting times ahead. [Revolution Analytics](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/), possibly the largest
commercial supporter of R, has been purchased by Microsoft.

Most people who know me have assumed I would be mad / disappointed /
upset / frustrated or otherwise annoyed. They would also be
wrong. This is terrific news.

This is very different from a seemingly similar, but disastrous,
situation when Oracle bought out Sun Microsystems and became the owner
of MySQL, OpenOffice.org and Java. When Oracle bought Sun, it became
the owner and primary driving force behind these valuable open source
properties. Since the purchase, Java has been a security
nightmare. MySQL has seen a flurry of proprietary extensions, but
comparatively little genuine development and OpenOffice.org was
abandoned and then resurrected as LibreOffice.

Microsoft's announcement is COMPLETELY different. They have purchased
a company that specializes in supporting R. Yes, Revolution Analytics
has done some valuable work developing R and it would be unfortunate
if those efforts were to diminish, but there is currently no
indication that is going to happen. In fact, I suspect the exact
opposite will occur. I suspect we will see more development. Some of
it may be proprietary, such as the Visual Studio extension, but some
of it will probably continue to be open source. And Microsoft has DEEP
pockets, so if they open source even a small fraction of what they do
to the community, it will help make R more popular and more useful.

More importantly, Microsoft cannot affect future R development in the
way Oracle has with MySQL. R-Core, CRAN, etc. are not part of this
deal. The R Foundation continues to drive the development of R and if
history is any indication, will continue to do an excellent job. R is
still FOSS and will remain so. This is just an opportunity to inject
more money and more opportunity into the ecosystem.

And that is a good thing.
