excerpt: Big flap about J Riddell. Much ado about nothing, but now a bruised community.

Let me start by stating this: I am not an official or unofficial
Kubuntu community member. I'm not even on the forum. That being said,
I have loved using Ubuntu and Kubuntu. I love what Ubuntu is doing,
but I've had a soft-place in my heart for KDE for a long time. I
started using Linux in the late 90s. Back then, I used SUSE (back when
it WAS spelled that way) and SUSE used KDE. I believe it was version
KDE 2.2 or so when I joined the band-wagon. Good stuff. I eventually
moved over to the Ubuntu camp but I continue to put Kubuntu on every
laptop in my house (if I own it).

I am deeply saddened by the massive, sudden dust-up I'm seeing in the
community. I do not know any of the players involved. I have read
their words. In Riddell's case, I've been reading his words for a VERY
long time. Is he passionate? Yes. Does he challenge people? Yes. And
I'm sure he bruised a few feelings along the way. But, the links I saw
from the CC, which purported to demonstrate his violations of the
Ubuntu CoC do not justify the CCs unprecedented response.

This is a long post, but worth reading:

I am really saddened by the Mark's role in this. Is Ubuntu a
democracy - of course not. But this dust-up seems to be unjustified
and completely tone-deaf to the needs of the Kubuntu Community which
is the largest and most successful of the various *buntu flavors.
