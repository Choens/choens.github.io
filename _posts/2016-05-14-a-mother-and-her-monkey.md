Leila is now two days old. Karen is still in SICU, but we were able to
sneak out long enough for her to meet her Monkey. This was, one of the
most incredible things I have ever seen.

Such a beautiful thing. And such a cute kid. Note: I (Dad) do the
exact same thing with my arm when I sleep. Crazy!
