Went down to Roundtop and had some fun riding the Fat Bike. It was a
good day, over-all. Rode some fast & flowy and a few trails that I
don't think were ever meant to be ridden.

For example, I climbed to the top. Not sure this trail is meant for
bikes. It was kinda silly, but that's how I roll too, so it was fine.
