excerpt: I don't have a clever title for this. Too bad.

I rather wish I had some witty title, but my usually unending source
of cheap punnies is empty. Thus, we shall get down to business. There
are two posts that all good geek blogs
need.

1. Hello World
2. A description of what we are doing here.

The first is absolutely critical. After-all, everyone knows the ONLY
way to experiment with new technology is to make it say Hello World.

[Wikipedia: Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program)

Fortunately, or not, I wrote that post nearly a month ago and it is
too soon for a Hello World II.

So, this is the latter necessary post. What are we doing here?
Frankly, I don't really know. In a nutshell, I guess I started this
for three reasons.

1. Writing a blog via GitHub / Markdown seemed like too much fun to
   pass up.
2. I need a place to put some training materials I want to develop.
3. Surely I have SOMETHING of interest to say. Even if absolutely
   nobody reads it.

Point # 2 is really the most important. There is an internal-facing
blog for the New York State Department of Health. On it, I intend to
post some materials and documentation. But, writing posts through the
web interface is PAINFUL. And, although I am only a second-rate HTML
developer (at my best) this is much easier and I can get nicer looking
results.

I can use the internal blogging tools to link to my posts and
materials here. It is reasonable to assume most of the discussion will
happen internally too although I would like to use Disqus as soon as I
figure it all out.

In the meantime, I guess I should go think relationally. I have some
SQL stuff I need to start writing down.
