[This](titanic/index.html) is pretty cool. I am developing a basic
introduction to using R, based on the Kaggle Titanic data. This is a
really cool data set that divides the known Titanic passengers into
two groups, a training set and a test set. Kaggle is using it as an
introduction into predictive modeline. I want to use it to introduce
people to R more broadly.

In keeping with the theme, each lesson will be referred to as a
SOS. For the time being, don't bookmark any page other than the
index.html file. All other files are subject to temporal and url
distortion as I tweak this.
