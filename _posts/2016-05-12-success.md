excerpt: Announcing Leila Anne Choens
---

It is my indescribable pleasure to announce to one and all the birth
of our daughter. Her name is Leila Anne Choens. Mom hasn't met her
yet, but that will change soon enough.

Both Mom and Monkey are doing well. Today, I am the happiest man
alive.

This is Leila on her very first birthday. At birth, she weighed four
pounds, nine ounces. The mask is giving her a little positive pressure
on her lungs as a precaution. Her blood-oxygen levels have been good,
so they are not giving her any oxygen. Just air.
