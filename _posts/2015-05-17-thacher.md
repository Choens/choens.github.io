It was a beautiful day. So beautiful, I decided I needed to ride my
bicycle to the top of Thacher State Park and take some pictures. With
the summer heating up, I need to get my legs strong for mountain
biking! The ridge in the background is where K and I got married.

Of course, being a beautiful day, the view into the valley was
terrific. It is a long ride from my house to Thacher and back. Takes a
little over two hours, so I don't do it often. But it is a very
rewarding ride. Lots of climbing (YEAH!), beautiful views, and some
FAST descents (sorry, no photos of the descent).
