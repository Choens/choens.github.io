excerpt: Should the Army of Northern Virginia Be Honored on a State Flag?

### Introduction

I would like to discuss state flags, especially Southern state flags
and their use of the battle flag of the Army of Northern
Virginia. This is a matter of much interest, in the aftermath of the
recent church shooting in South Carolina. I'd like to take a moment to
put this debate into some context as only a Southerner, with a
penchant for history, can do. In the past few days I've read a lot
about the history of the Civil War and the causal relationship between
the institution of slavery and the outbreak of the Civil War. Read the
[Corner Stone Speech](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822142313/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/)
by Alexander Stephens of Georgia, the Vice President of the
Confederate States of America (CSA): 

> Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its
> foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth
> that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery
> subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal
> condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of
> the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral
> truth.

It is a long speech, but it is clear. The Vice President of the CSA
believed Africans were inferior to Caucasians. Let that sink in a
minute. Apparently, he wasn't the only redneck in Georgia inclined to
hate on people for the color of their skin. When Georgia secceeded
from the union, it provided an official statement explaining this
decision. The following sentence is the FIRST LINE in that rationale:

> The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection
> with the Government of the United States of America, present to
> their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the
> separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious
> causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States
> with reference to the subject of African slavery.

Clearly, the State of Georgia thought slavery was a motivator for
war. So did South Carolina.

> The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled,
> on the 26th day of April, A.D., 1852, declared that the frequent
> violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal
> Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the
> States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the
> Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the
> other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this
> right. Since that time, these encroachments have continued to
> increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue.

Had they used a period after "Federal Union" the word "slaveholding"
would have appeared in the second line. But, they used a semi-colon;
so they tie with Georgia. Both states make reference to slavery in the
first sentence of their official rationales for seccession. It is
true, there were other cultural and economic differences between the
North and the South, but these would have been inconsequential without
the peculiar institution of slavery.

Fun Fact: The Confederate "Battle flag" was never the national flag of the
CSA. It was, to quote General Beauregard, a "Battle flag". It was
originally square, not rectangular, reducing the amount of material
needed to make it. The design was actually rejected by the "Committee
on the Flag and Seal", the group officially responsible for designing
the national flag of the CSA. The flag most closely associated with
the Confederacy was, in reality, just a Battle flag of their largest
army. Over time, this flag would be adopted by other groups within the
Confederacy and it would appear as part of the official flag, but the
criss-cross bars of the Confederate Battle flag would never be
officially recognized as the official flag of the CSA.

This Southerner thinks it is sad the Confederate Battle flag still
flies over the heads of American citizens. It shouldn't. Americans, of
all colors, deserve better. Let it fly in our history books and our
museums. The shooting at Emanuel AME should be a catalyst; the birth
of a nation. But unlike
[D.W. Griffith's film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=302YMeiDSrI), a
nation born into unity and equality for all.

### About The Author

I think it is necessary that I discuss my own background, vis-a-vis
this debate. I grew up in great state of Georgia in a little town
called Valdosta. Valdosta is the home of my highschool team, The
Wildcats, Valdosta State University and more rednecks than most
Yankees think you can squeeze into a Wal-Mart parking lot. Today, I
live in Albany New York and like to jokingly introduce myself as the
token redneck. I'm a history nut, raised in the South. I'm a peculiar
mix of Southern redneck and Yankee liberal. I also have a Master's
Degree in Social Welfare and work as a consultant with state
governments to improve social service programs. I think Churchill
would have described me as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
enigma. Sadly, he used that phrase to describe a different group of
people.

### The Georgia State Flag 1956 - 2001

I was in highschool when
[Zell Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zell_Miller#Governor)
unsuccessfully fought to remove the Battle flag from the Georgia State
flag. Zell Miller was a good governor, but a terrible Senator. This is
the flag I grew up with. It is a little, rebellious.

In fact, this was the
[Georgia State flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)#1956_flag)
for 45 years. Nearly half a century of overtly segregationist ideals!
Fortunately for all involved, Georgia doesn't keep many records
documenting the thought and logic of legislative deliberations. This
is terribly convenient for elected officials. After-all, if there is
no official record of what you said, you can always change it later!
We do know the 1956 flag was designed by a man named John Sammons Bell
who was publicly pro-segregation. He was also a Democrat. Irony
alert. Zell Miller, a Democrat, wanted to change a flag designed by a
member of his own party. He was staunchly opposed by conservative
Republicans. Seriously, I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Conservatives love to claim the Battle flag represents "Heritage, not
hate". I want to be perfectly clear. This claim is bullshit of the
highest order. But I can't laugh because so many Southerners truly
believe it. Conservative intellectuals have successfully altered,
hidden or revised Southern history in a bid to white wash the sin and  In the context of the Georgia debate, supporters of the
1956 flag claimed it was part of the State's efforts to mark the
centennial of the beginning of the Civil War. Astute historians will
note that the centennial occurred in 1961, not 1956. Legislative
bodies rarely do anything on time; this seems an unlikely
exception. Fortunately, 1856 was not a boring year! Perhaps they were
marking other high points of American history such as:

- May 16: The Vigilance Committee is founded in San Francisco. It
  lynches some gangsters, arrests a bunch of Democrats and disbands a
  few months later.
- May 21: Lawrence Kansas is sacked by pro-slavery forces.
- Senator Preston Brooks, South Carolina, beats the shit out of
  Charles Sumner, Massachussetts, after the latter gave a speech
  criticizing pro-slavery violence in Kansas. Charles Preston was
  regarded as a hero in South Carolina. Sumner would not return to the
  Senate for three years.
- May 24: New York abolitionist John Brown and his supporters kill
  five pro-slavery homesteaders in Kansas.
- June 2: John Brown's forces defeat pro-slavery forces at the Battle
  of Black Jack.
- August 30: Pro-slavery forces defeat abolitionist forces at the
  Battle of Osawatomie.

The Civil Rights movement was enjoying more success than it had since
Reconstruction ended. In 1956, the US Supreme Court struck down laws
enforcing segregation on busses.  And Conservatives want us to believe
the legislature drew that flag to celebrate Johnny Reb?

## Lower The Damned Flag

Efforts to white wash the decision to change the Georgia State flag in
1956 are only revolting because so many people believe them. It is
incredible as it is true. People actually believe this shit and most
of them are not consciously or overtly racist. They may not exactly
"like" Black people but they are hardly members of the KKK. I believe
a story may help illustrate my point.

When I was a teenager, my Boy Scout troop was visiting the USS XYZ, an
aircraft carrier from World War II. Boy Scout troops are allowed to
spend the night on the ship. My troop, from South Georgia, was
unpacking our sleeping bags in one room, when a troop from Atlanta
came into an adjoining room. Every single member of my troop was
White. Every single member of the troop from Atlanta was Black. A
member of my troop had brought, for some reason, a Confederate Battle
flag with him. I have no idea why he thought that would be useful or
appropriate on a US aircraft carrier. He had laid the Confederate flag
on top of his sleeping bag. Several scouts from the Atlanta troop saw
the flag and came into our room and an argument quickly ensued. Myself
and one other senior scout took the Confederate flag and hid it out of
sight and apologized. We were able to defuse the situation before it
became a fight. The amazing part of the encounter was when I realized
that several members of my troop did not understand why the other boys
had responded so strongly to the flag. They were young, but they
weren't stupid. They knew about slavery and the civil war. But, they
had been taught that the flag was about "Heritage". I believe these
kids were genuinely confused and offended when they were accused of
being racist.

Neo-nazis are a little more honest with themselves. At least they
recognize their divisive symbolism for what it is. White America wants
desperately to believe an interpretation of the Civil War that only
exists in Gone With The Wind.

I do partially agree with one argument made by Conservatives. Lowering
the Confederate Battle flag forever won't end our long history of
bigotry and intolerance. German laws prohibit the public display of
the Swatstika, but neo-nazi groups continue to flourish there. But
this is a shallow argument. No citizen should be forced to walk under
a flag which symbolizes one of our nation's worst sins. For African
Americans this is symbolically important. It is unconscionable to me
to think we are, as a nation, so globally ignorant of our own history
as to doubt what that symbol means. It is the symbol of slavery. Take
it down. Retire it to history and reenactments. The birth of a nation
never ends.
