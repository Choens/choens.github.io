We have been dog-sitting for K's parents while they are in Alaska. We
took Mr. Major (the dog) to an art show. He got a little antsy, but
managed to look quite adorable. Of course.

At home, not shown in these photos, we have two cats. The female cat,
Skye, gets along well with the dog. Our male cat, Bandito, also gets
along pretty well with the dog. They don't fight or cause trouble
really, but the cat gets so incredibly jealous of the dog. He is
terribly offended by our willingness to take the dog outside several
times a day, but he isn't allowed out even once.

Tough shit kitty.    :-)

Her parents will be back in a few days, and then the house will be
much quieter.

In the meantime, I'm up to my ears in critters.
