The Titanic Introduction to R is a series of small lessons intended to
introduce new users to R, using a real data set. The data set used in
these lessons is the Titanic Disaster data set, courtesy of
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted). These
courses assume you have never used R. Kaggle used this data as part of
an introduction to machine learning. My goal is broader and will
include a wide variety of skills relevant to data science, including
machine learning.

R is different from analytic tools such as SAS and SPSS, which many
readers may learned in school. Simply put, R is not a tool for
statistical analysis. It is a general-purpose programming language
developed by statisticians and researchers for data analysis. To new
users, the difference is largely pedantic. However, the difference
between these traditional analysis tools and R is dramatic. SAS and
SPSS tend to encourage relatively linear programming, with limited
ability to build custom functions, do complex looping and other common
programming tasks. To the extent these abilities exist at all, they
were often added as after thoughts may years later. Because R is a
programming language, you get all the facilities you would expect in a
programming language.

Users familiar with Perl will find R to be somewhat similar in that
there is nearly always more than 3 different ways to do the same
thing. It is nearly infinitely flexible. R can be extended by the user
RIGHT NOW. You can install additional packages or write your
own. Currently, there are over
[6,000 packages](http://www.r-bloggers.com/milestone-6000-packages-on-cran/)
available for R on
[CRAN - The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.us.r-project.org/). And
there are many many more available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/trending?l%3DR) and
[BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/).

Although this diversity and power is incredible, it is also more than
a little scary. It took less than a year for the R community to go
from 5K packages available on CRAN to 6K. I am an experienced R user
and a reasonably decent statistician, yet I don't understand what half
of the packages on CRAN do. Just
[scroll down the list](http://cran.us.r-project.org/). If you can
explain to me what
[this thing](http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/ouch/ouch.pdf)
does, please explain it to me (using SIMPLE words). I have absolutely
no idea.

The goal of this series is to go through the basics of R and introduce
the reader to some of the woolier aspects of R. There are lots of
introductions to R, but they tend to ignore tools made by people like
[Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/). Although these tools are useful
to advanced users of R, I believe they should be part of a thorough
introduction to R, because they make R easier to use.

# Disclaimer

As of right now, these materials are a moving target. I may add,
delete, reorder, rearrange or otherwise rewrite any of this material
at any time. Do NOT bookmark the individual lessons. Bookmark the
relevant page on my blog, which will always include a links to the
current lessons.

If you have any comments, criticisms, suggestions or just want to talk
like a pirate, send me an email.

# Episodes

Please be aware, that while these materials are all hosted on GitHub
by me, the theme, organization and menu will change. For the geeks - I am using
GitHub's Jekyll system to create the HTML content you see here. The
individual episodes of this tutorial are made by exporting a Emacs
org-mode file to HTML.
